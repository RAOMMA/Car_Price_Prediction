## Car Price Prediction

This Python script predicts the price of a car based on various features using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Car Price Dataset
- **Data Source**: upload on git
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - Feature columns: Year, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, Owner.
  - Target column: Car price.

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **car_price_prediction.py**: Python script for predicting car prices.
- **model.pkl**: Pre-trained machine learning model for car price prediction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fake-news-detection

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the pre-trained machine learning model ('model.pkl') in the same directory as the script ('car_price_prediction.py').
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script with the required arguments:

    ```
    python car_price_prediction.py --Year 2022 --Present_Price 10.5 --Kms_Driven 50000 --Fuel_Type Petrol --Seller_Type Dealer --Transmission Manual --Owner 1

## Model Training
The project uses a machine learning model to predict car prices. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.pkl'.

## Features Encoding
The script encodes categorical columns such as 'Fuel_Type', 'Seller_Type', and 'Transmission' for proper model input.

## Results
The project provides predictions for car prices based on the input features.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the project:

Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
